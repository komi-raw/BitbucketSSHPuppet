# Bitbucket key Publisher

This is a simple project that helps in key publishing automation for huge projects.

The idea is storing your account and key in the ***.env*** file, then run the app.

## Install

```bash
# Will install the following deps:
# - puppeteer
# - dotenv

npm install
```

## Start

```bash
npm run start
```

# TLDR

Nothing fancy, just auto-push auth keys to bitbucket. - Komi-raw
